# Concepts from A8C JS Town Hall

## Usage

Open each respective `*.html` file in your browser and open your Javascript console. Every comment with a `>` like this:

    // > something
    
Should correspond with a message you seen in your console.

These are the topics we went over:

### Objects
What are they and how do you work with them?

### var
How it works and why you must use it.

### functions
How to define them and manipulate them to do things they weren't
intended to do.

### Prototype
How the Javascript prototype object model works and how to use it
to your advantage.
